# Contributing
If you're reading this, you're likely looking to contribute to this wiki. If so, this page will walk you through the basics, and hopefully act as a somewhat decent starting place.

## Pages

### How pages work
Wiki.js handles pages and categories by treating them similarly to a filesystem. You have "folders" which represent categories and sub-categories (etc.), and pages.
This allows us to differentiate between the name of a page, and its path in the URL as well, for example:
A page at `/objects/clothing/torso/sweater` means that there is a page whose "file" is called `sweater`, living inside the category `objects`, subcategory `clothing`, sub-subcategory `torso`.
This file itself can then have a different name like `Sweater` (note the capitalisation) or `Jumper` (if we wanted the British English word). The in-text title of that page, as well as its content is then free to change as much or as little as pleased without causing any links that point to it to fail.
The content of pages in Wiki.js can take a variety of formats, with Markdown, ASCIIDoc and Raw HTML natively supported (though we ***strongly*** recommend the use of Markdown for consistency and maintainability). Additionally, features like PlantUML diagrams and Katex (LaTeX-like math and chemistry typesetting) are supported through plugins.
