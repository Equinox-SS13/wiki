# Wiki Etiquette and Guidelines
The following are general etiquettes and guidelines that editors should follow to keep the content consistent and easy to read. This is not an enforced rule, but should be considered as much as possible.

## General Etiquette
- Follow the server rules and common sense, even if outside of the server.
  + Page vandalism is not allowed, this includes any addition, removal, or modification that intentionally misrepresent or disruptive in any ways.
  + Edit wars, spite edit, or bahavior of the similar kind is not to be tolerated.
- This wiki uses proper American English spelling. Although using British English spelling is fine, do not make edits to correct American English spelling to British English spelling.
- After performing a major edit, a comment should be stated on discord as to what you did. This allows better communication between the maintainers and contributors.
- Any edits to lore should be notified to the lore team on discord first. SoP and Law pages are not to be touched without permission.

## General Guidelines
- It is very important to stay on topic, do not divert from the title. If explanation for something is needed, link to a new article/page.
- If a page is unfinished, or otherwise work-in-progress, use the function to keep the page unpublished until it is ready.
- Capitalize special names, proper nounds, or unique places.
- If a page within the same subcategory (such as species, faction detail, etc.) exists, try to replicate the same base formatting and section topics.
- Refrain from using existing character's names, real life references, or making random jokes.
- Refrain from using strikethrough, random bolding, scaled up text, or otherwise random formatting.

## About Category

Category should be used sparingly and only if necessary. Multiple articles related on the same topic may be bunched up together using a category, but a small numbers of articles with the same topic can simply be found using the search function using the keyword.

This is to prevent redundancy in over-saturated category list, making the function difficult if not inconvenient to use.

The following are guideline for categorizing your article;

### Rules and Guidelines
* `rules and guidelines` is used for "Out of Character" or otherwise not game-based articles, such as game rules, guidelines for playing a role enforcable out of the game.

### Guide
* `guide` is used for articles explaining mechanics of the game. The following category should be added alongside the `guide` category;
  * `starter guide` is used to explain basic mechanics of the game present now matter the setup or character job.
  * `medical guide`, `engineering guide`, or those with departmental name in it is used to category guide specific to the department for ease of access.
    * However, an alternative search method of `medical` and `guide` together should work also work, it is encouraged to put the related department without the word "guide" alongside it.
  * `other guide` is used to categorize guides that do not fall into either of the two above; a niche mechanic that is not common or frequently seen, and is not a part specific to a single faction or department.
  
### Lore
* `lore` is used to explain lore related to the game and should be used alongside the following below.
* `faction` relates to articles explaining lore specific to a faction, which, in turn should be categorized alongside;
    * `antagonist` for antagonist factions
    * `medical`, `engineering`, or faction name for lore specific to that faction
* `lore: planned but not implemented`, `lore: not canon`, and `lore: canon` should be used to clarify the stage of a lore article alongside the use of [Lore Template](/maintenance/Template#lore-template) at the start of the article.
    
### Maintenance
* Maintenance categories such as `maintenance: work in progress`, `maintenance: needs revision`, etcetera are to denote the state of the article. These should be used alongside [Maintenance Template](/maintenance/Template#maintenance-template) at the start of the article.
