# Editing Tips!

You can mix HTML and markdown!

> Note that html will work at any point inside markdown, however, if you wish to use markdown inside HTML, you need to include an empty line between the HTML tag above the markdown, otherwise the renderer will ignore the markdown definition. See the dropdown example below for what is meant.
{.is-warning}

For example, to render a dropdown:
## Dropdown {.tabset}

### Code
```html
<details>
  <summary>
    
What you want showing when the dropdown is closed. (***It even supports markdown!***)
  </summary>
  
  The contents of the dropdown. Yup, this bit _supports markdown too_!
</details>
```
