So, you've elected to play as a Psionic, or perhaps you're just curious about those weirdoes running around melting other people's brains. Fear not, for this page will get you a general idea of what a Psionic is!

# Lore
If you've ever ventured down into Deep Maintenance, you've probably encountered some weird entities. And if you were extra unlucky, you might have ran into the Hound and the Dreaming King Himself. Unfortunately for all Psionics, He is the source of their powers. Every Psionic is inevitably linked to the Dreaming King, and merely borrow His powers for their petty uses.

So what makes a Psionic a Psionic? Cancer. A benign tumor that grows in their brain, to be precise. The Soteria Institute is capable of culturing and implanting these tumors, but they all still link back to the Dreaming King regardless. For most psions, they were "gifted" the tumor by the Dreaming King, and some may even refer to their tumors as their Ascended Flesh.

For reasons unknown, the tumor violently rejects any sort of implants or augmentations in their host, forcefully ejecting even the simplest death alarm implants out of the body. Many psions have taken this in stride, and claim that they are maintaining the purity of their body, however other observers have noted that they are merely coping.

# Powers
> This section is transcluded from the Sojourn wiki.

Psionic powers have a description you may view in game at any time under the psionic powers tab. The name of the power and its associated cost are in parenthesis next to it, by mousing over the power in the bottom left corner (below your typing window) you'll see a full explanation of what the power does. Powers are listed here as well, for quick and easy reference.

## Lesser Powers
Lesser powers are usually a single point or free to use for a psion, they represent the general abilities any psion can use, though more cognitively impressive psions can use them far more often.

  <tr>
    <th>Power Name (Cost)</th>
    <th>Effect</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kinetic Orb (0)</td>
    <td>Creates a kinetic orb in hand that functions like a projectile weapon, expending a single psi point per shot to deliver a potentially lethal ranged blast.</td>
    <td>Unlike other physical powers, this orb scales off of your cognition. While allowing you to stay at range, it is most costly to use than psychic blade and doesn't get bonus damage from two handing or having high robustness.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Psychosomatic healing (1)</td>
    <td>Heal yourself for up to 40 brute AND burn, but you take heavy amounts of agony from the effect and may be stunned.</td>
    <td>Toughness mitigates the effect and allow you to resist both the stun and pain damage, painkillers and racial resistance also help. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Telepathic projection (1)</td>
    <td>Project your mind into the thoughts of others, allowing you to send telepathic messages over any distance. This is primarily words, but may include brief, vague snippets of emotions or other sensory information.</td>
    <td>This does not work on lesser life forms, people with mind shielding such as cruciforms, or synthetic minds.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Psychic Blade (1)</td>
    <td>Create a psionic blade in your hand that functions as a knife, the power of which scales with your robustness per attack. Does not function as a viable tool.</td>
    <td>This object is temporary, when it leaves your hand for any reason it disappears. The power of the knife is deceptive, with every attack the damage is actively calculated off your robustness (debuffs such as flashbangs weaken it). At nine or less, you do the same as a knife. At ten to nineteen you deal the same as a butcher knife. At twenty to twenty nine, you deal the same as a machete. At thirty or higher, you deal the same as a longsword.  </td>

    <td>Psychosomatic healing (1)</td>
    <td>Heal yourself for up to 40 brute AND burn, but you take heavy amounts of agony from the effect and may be stunned.</td>

  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Psychic Shield (1)</td>
    <td>Create a psionic shield that can block melee attacks, bullets, or energy beams.</td>
    <td>Functions exactly like a standard shield. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Psychosomatic Transference (1)</td>
    <td>Instantly refill your nutrition to full at the expense of some of your blood and taking some toxins.</td>
    <td>You gain 100% nutrition but lose 54 units of blood (10%) and take 15 toxins. Easy to recover from with the right reagents. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Telekinetic Prowess (1)</td>
    <td>You gain telekinesis, allowing you to pick up objects and move them around, as well as interact with some objects at range. Careful, as you can hurt yourself and others using this (unless that's what you want).</td>
    <td>Can be used to do a variety of things and can only be removed by willingly ending it or through scientific methods. Using this power, once activated, does not cost any psi points. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>End Telekinesis (0)</td>
    <td>End your telekinesis. You may reactivate telekinesis by spending another psi point.</td>
    <td>Useful for if you get tired of picking up random objects or pushing walls when randomly clicking your screen to face various directions. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Telekinetic Fist (1)</td>
    <td>Create a one hit use psi fist in your hand which deals damage and knock back based on your current robustness when used.</td>
    <td>This is a temporary item that will vanish if it leaves your hand. This power vanishes after one attack, but deals damage that scales the same as the psychic blade while dealing 2/4/6 tile knock-back depending on your robustness. </td>
  </tr>
      <tr>
    <td>Pyrokinetic Spark(1)</td>
    <td>Expend a single point of your psi essence to create a tiny flickering fire in your hand that will shine light and ignite combustible materials, can be thrown but will extinguish quickly </td>
    <td>Great for lighting cigarettes and burning pieces of paper.</td>
