So, you've elected to play as a Psionic, or perhaps you're just curious about those weirdoes running around melting other people's brains. Fear not, for this page will get you a general idea of what a Psionic is!

# Lore
If you've ever ventured down into Deep Maintenance, you've probably encountered some weird entities. And if you were extra unlucky, you might have ran into the Hound and the Dreaming King Himself. Unfortunately for all Psionics, He is the source of their powers. Every Psionic is inevitably linked to the Dreaming King, and merely borrow His powers for their petty uses.

So what makes a Psionic a Psionic? Cancer. A benign tumor that grows in their brain, to be precise. The Soteria Institute is capable of culturing and implanting these tumors, but they all still link back to the Dreaming King regardless. For most psions, they were "gifted" the tumor by the Dreaming King, and some may even refer to their tumors as their Ascended Flesh.

For reasons unknown, the tumor violently rejects any sort of implants or augmentations in their host, forcefully ejecting even the simplest death alarm implants out of the body. Many psions have taken this in stride, and claim that they are maintaining the purity of their body, however other observers have noted that they are merely coping.

# Powers
> This section is transcribed from the Sojourn wiki.
{.is-info}

Psionic powers have a description you may view in game at any time under the psionic powers tab. The name of the power and its associated cost are in parenthesis next to it, by mousing over the power in the bottom left corner (below your typing window) you'll see a full explanation of what the power does. Powers are listed here as well, for quick and easy reference.

## Lesser Powers
Lesser powers are usually a single point or free to use for a psion, they represent the general abilities any psion can use, though more cognitively impressive psions can use them far more often.

    <th>Power Name (Cost)</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kinetic Orb (0)</td>
    <td>Creates a kinetic orb in hand that functions like a projectile weapon, expending a single psi point per shot to deliver a potentially lethal ranged blast.</td>
    <td>Unlike other physical powers, this orb scales off of your cognition. While allowing you to stay at range, it is most costly to use than psychic blade and doesn't get bonus damage from two handing or having high robustness.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Psychosomatic healing (1)</td>
    <td>Heal yourself for up to 40 brute AND burn, but you take heavy amounts of agony from the effect and may be stunned.</td>
    <td>Toughness mitigates the effect and allow you to resist both the stun and pain damage, painkillers and racial resistance also help. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Telepathic projection (1)</td>
    <td>Project your mind into the thoughts of others, allowing you to send telepathic messages over any distance. This is primarily words, but may include brief, vague snippets of emotions or other sensory information.</td>
    <td>This does not work on lesser life forms, people with mind shielding such as cruciforms, or synthetic minds.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Psychic Blade (1)</td>
    <td>Create a psionic blade in your hand that functions as a knife, the power of which scales with your robustness per attack. Does not function as a viable tool.</td>
    <td>This object is temporary, when it leaves your hand for any reason it disappears. The power of the knife is deceptive, with every attack the damage is actively calculated off your robustness (debuffs such as flashbangs weaken it). At nine or less, you do the same as a knife. At ten to nineteen you deal the same as a butcher knife. At twenty to twenty nine, you deal the same as a machete. At thirty or higher, you deal the same as a longsword.  </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Psychosomatic healing (1)</td>
    <td>Heal yourself for up to 40 brute AND burn, but you take heavy amounts of agony from the effect and may be stunned.</td>
    <td>Toughness may mitigate the effect and allow you to resist both the stun and pain damage, painkillers and racial resistance may help. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Psychic Shield (1)</td>
    <td>Create a psionic shield that can block melee attacks, bullets, or energy beams.</td>
    <td>Functions exactly like a standard shield. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Psychosomatic Transference (1)</td>
    <td>Instantly refill your nutrition to full at the expense of some of your blood and taking some toxins.</td>
    <td>You gain 100% nutrition but lose 54 units of blood (10%) and take 15 toxins. Easy to recover from with the right reagents. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Telekinetic Prowess (1)</td>
    <td>You gain telekinesis, allowing you to pick up objects and move them around, as well as interact with some objects at range. Careful, as you can hurt yourself and others using this (unless that's what you want).</td>
    <td>Can be used to do a variety of things and can only be removed by willingly ending it or through scientific methods. Using this power, once activated, does not cost any psi points. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>End Telekinesis (0)</td>
    <td>End your telekinesis. You may reactivate telekinesis by spending another psi point.</td>
    <td>Useful for if you get tired of picking up random objects or pushing walls when randomly clicking your screen to face various directions. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Telekinetic Fist (1)</td>
    <td>Create a one hit use psi fist in your hand which deals damage and knock back based on your current robustness when used.</td>
    <td>This is a temporary item that will vanish if it leaves your hand. This power vanishes after one attack, but deals damage that scales the same as the psychic blade while dealing 2/4/6 tile knock-back depending on your robustness. </td>
  </tr>
      <tr>
    <td>Pyrokinetic Spark(1)</td>
    <td>Expend a single point of your psi essence to create a tiny flickering fire in your hand that will shine light and ignite combustible materials, can be thrown but will extinguish quickly </td>
    <td>Great for lighting cigarettes and burning pieces of paper.</td>

## Greater Powers
Greater powers are psionic abilities that cost more essence and may not be usable if you lack the cognition to have enough of a essence pool. These powers are much more useful as a result and range from 2-5 in point cost. Greater powers may come with restrictions or other unusual effects.


| Power Name (Cost) | Effect | Notes |
|--|--|--|
| Telekinetic Omnitool (2) | Create an omnitool which has tool qualities based on 80% of your biology and mechanical skills, allowing it to function as a mechanical or surgical tool. It works at 80% speed and cannot be upgraded. | This object is temporary, when it leaves your hand for any reason it disappears. It does not require power and cannot wear down or break.|
| Psionic Tool Construction (2) | Using an oddity, you create a permanent tool out of it, sacrificing the oddity to have it randomly become a tool. The oddities stats affect what is most likely to be created, but the choice is still random. | Creates one of six potential tools. The tools are lesser than their high tier counterparts, but have odd qualities and come with themes. Some may be used as weapons but generally are not as effective as actual psi-weapons. These can be modified and upgrade.|
| Meditative Focus(2) | Expend two psi points of your psi essence to focus your mind and increase your sanity. | |
| Psionic Weapon Construction (3) | Using an oddity, you create a permanent weapon out of it, sacrificing the oddity to have it randomly become a range weapon. The oddities stats affect what is most likely to be created, but the choice is still random. Psionic guns '''do not''' come loaded. | Creates one six random guns. All guns are 10% to 20% weaker than than their official versions. All weapons come with a specific style, name, and description that makes them more interesting and reveal their nature. These can be modified and upgraded.|
| Psionic Melee Construction (3) | Using an oddity, you create a permanent weapon out of it, sacrificing the oddity to have it randomly become a melee weapon. The oddities stats affect what is most likely to be created, but the choice is still random. | Creates one six random melee weapons. They have unusual but crappy tool qualities and are suited better as decent weapons, though are easily outshone end game weaponry. All weapons come with a specific style, name, and description that makes them more interesting and reveal their nature. These can be modified and upgraded.|
| Psychic Call (3) | You call burrowing creatures from all nearby burrows and cracks. What appears is random. None of the things called are inherently friendly to you, meaning you may call things that are hostile and attack you and your allies. | Useful if you need a distraction, cannon fodder, you're a cht'mant looking to (hopefully) call roaches or spiders to your location. Use at your own risk.|
| Psychic Banish (4) | You force all burrowing creatures to flee from you, forcing them to go inside their burrows and leave for parts unknown. | Some creatures may actively try to resist the affect. Only works on creatures capable of burrowing and only if a burrow they can reach is nearby. Resisting creatures will still attack if you get close and may give up if they cannot reach the burrow.|
| Psionic Armor (4) | You create a suit of psionic armor which provides decent all round protection for you. Using this power destroys whatever armor, boots, gloves, and hat you are wearing. The suit enhances your cognition for each piece your wearing but they disappear if you remove it for any reason. | Your suit provides armor 35 in most areas and comes with neat utility bonuses like +20 cognition if you're wearing the full set. The gloves and boots are both insulated and the boots prevent slipping. On top of that, the hood provides a mood setting light and the entire thing is space worthy.|
| Journey to Nowhere (5) | You teleport yourself, whatever you are holding or wearing, and any person you are grabbing to the nightmare realm known as deep maintenance. You are not guaranteed safety and the effect weakens you on arrival. While you will always land in an empty spot, you may be surrounded by traps or possibly hostile life forms that will rip you limb from limb immediately. | '''Do not use this unless you are heavily armored, carrying lots of supplies, and prepared. Taking yourself and an unwilling subject is considered attempted murder. Keep in mind, as a psion, if you die in deep maintenance it is unlikely you will be found and rescued.|

## Job Specific Powers
Job specific powers are linked to a specific job and cannot normally be obtained without playing that specific job. Unlike standard or greater powers, these are generally thematic and may cost lesser or more points than either.


|
| Power Name (Cost) || Effect || Notes
| Psychosomatic Restoration (2) || You heal whoever you are presently grabbing for damage similar to psychosomatic healing, but weaker and a little safer. || Heals 30 brute and 30 burn at the cost of double the psi essence. This power, however, doesn't cause pain like its lesser variant.
| Psionic Tranquillity(2) || Expend two psi points of your psi essence to calm the mind of another person you are grappling and restore their sanity.
| Cerebral Regeneration (3) || Heals the mind of whoever you are grappling or yourself if you are currently grabbing nobody. When used on yourself, the power cost is reduced to 0. || This power heals all brain damage instantly but does not cure the effect that caused the brain damage so additional healing may be needed. Works on people who are unconscious but not dead. The cost is free if used on yourself.
| Gift of the Psion (7) || You reach into the mind of another you are grappling and attempt to empower them, giving you different effects based on what they are. This power requires massive amounts of essence to use and its highly suggested that you take the time to provide actual psychological help in the mean time. || When grappling someone this power grants different perks based on if the target is a psion or not. In a psion, they gain psionic grace and in a non-psion they gain mind over matter. Do keep in mind, using this power '''logs and messages admins''', so be sure to employ actual roleplay and try not to game the benefit too much.

# Psionic Perks
Psionic powers may be effected by perks, which can be gained by background character options, oddities, or other effects in round. Psionic perks are usually pretty limited towards what they effect, but can drastically change your play style depending on what they do and what you have. Below is a list of perks that psions may potentially have.

|
| Perk || Description || Effect
| Psion || You have, through some method you may or may not understand, delved into the secrets of psionic ascension and gained powers beyond your understanding. While your mind has become far stronger, your body has weakened slightly. You take increased damage from all sources and require a bit more food to support the specialized organs you've developed. Additionally, you must always maintain purity of body, any implants, cruciforms, or synthetics will be violently rejected as long as your psionic organ is in your head. || Given by your psion organ. Take +20% brute/burn/oxygen/toxins, very minuscule hunger increase, an additional organ in your head, and all non-organic implants, modules, or body parts are forcefully and painfully ejected from the body.
| Psionic Psychosis|| You lived a life of unsettled violence. Maybe it was circumstance, maybe it was necessity, or maybe you just liked hurting people. No matter the reason, your mind is attuned to bloody violence and your potential as a psion reflects that. No matter your stats or physical body, you always deal maximum damage when using scaling psionic weaponry you create.|| Any temporary psionic item that scales off of any stat deals its maximum damage regardless of your abilities. (Telekinetic fist always deals 33 damage and has 6 tile knock-back, psychic blade deals 33 damage per hit, etc. etc.)
| Psionic Harmony || You have achieved inner harmony, your balance of emotion giving you peace of mind and thus expanding your potential as a psion. With this frame of mind, you retain a higher maximum psi pool than others, increasing your capacity by two.|| Your maximum psi points increases by 2. This effect stacks.
| Psionic Attunement || You have, through practice or innate talent, mastered your psionic abilities to such a degree that you have greater control of the negative side effects of your powers. Whenever you use a psionic power that has negative side effects, you take only half the penalties a psion normally would. || You take 50% less penalty when using abilities like psychosomatic healing, psychosomatic transference. etc. etc. You also remove the cost of using telepathy and telekinetic prowess. 
| Mind Master || Your training as a Soteria psychologist and understanding of psychiatry has given you a deep understanding of how the mind works. As a result, if you became a psion, you have an expanded set of powers that aid you in your work, with additional essence to use your abilities.|| Your maximum psi points increases by 5. This effect stacks.
| Psionic Grace || The latent effects of a fellow psion with mastery over the mind has enhanced your abilities. The gifted enhancement allows you to recover your psi essence twice as fast. || The time it takes to recover psi essence is halved.
| Mind over Matter || You felt the grace of a psion touching your mind and bringing about a level of peace and perfection you never quite considered. Now, as a result, your body and mind work beyond any potential they once had. || You gain a +10 to all stats for the remainder of the shift. This perk is only available to non-psions.
