## Server Rules
These are rules applied to the game server.

* **Rule 0**: Above all else, treat each other with the respect your fellow player deserves.

* **Rule 1**: No minors. No one under the age of 18.

* **Rule 2**: Maintain high standards of roleplay at all possible times. Keep your actions, motivations, and character reasonable and believable.

* **Rule 3**: Do not metacommunicate significant or actionable information about the current round. This includes but is not limited to antagonist types or statuses, round types, major events, and similar. 
  * An example of appropriate communication is “The round is currently half an hour in.” 
  * An example of inappropriate communication is “I died in maint; please come pick me up at the junction by the hole and the substation.”

* **Rule 4**: Self-Antagonism is permissible with admin approval. If you do not receive a response, you must assume the answer is no.

* **Rule 5**: Have a reasonable skillset for the age and profession of your character.

* **Rule 6**: Escalation in conflict should be performed reasonably. Responding to an insult with rifle fire is not okay. 
  * If you wish to start an altercation with another player as a non-antagonist, please ahelp it first if it is more than a minor disagreement. 
  * Yelling at someone to get out of your department is okay; picking up a gun and blasting them in the chest if they don’t leave is not. 

* **Rule 7**: No end of round grief.

* **Rule 8**: Exploiting bugs for personal or power game advantage is forbidden.

* **Rule 9**: Ahelp during a round, or ask in discord outside of a round, if you need clarification on a rule.

* **Rule 10**: Do not link NSFW art in your description without marking it as NSFW

* **Rule 11**: The administration has the final say on any ruling regarding rules. If you feel a ruling is incorrect, forward a complaint to the Head Administrator.

## Discord Rules
These rules applied to our Discord server.

* **Rule #0**: Speak respectfully to other members on the server. No slurs or personal attacks.

* **Rule #1**: No minors. No one under the age of 18.

* **Rule #2**: Keep lengthy discussions in their relevant channels. Asides are fine, but longer-form discussions should be relegated to the appropriate channel. 
  * Similarly, keep NSFW content in the NSFW channels. If you have to ask if it’s appropriate for a specific NSFW channel, put it in that one.

* **Rule #3**: Please be mindful and respectful of discussions around politics and life events. If you are asked to stop by a participant in a discussion, please do so.

* **Rule #4**: Enforcement of rules is at the discretion of server administration. If you are concerned about how enforcement is handled, please take your complaints to the Head Administrator, or a Host.

* **Rule #6**: When asked if you have read the rules of the server, your response should mention how you feel about dinosaurs.

## Server Guidance
We ask you to consider the following points on generating fun for players. While not explicit rules, please join us in engendering the spirit of fun and roleplay we seek to create.

1. Antagonists set the tone and pacing for combat. 

* If antags lead with words and bluff, the crew should reply with words and reasoning. If antags lead with bullets, they should reasonably be shot on sight from that point on.
<br>

2. Antagonists are here to make the round interesting rather than greentext at all costs. 

* Given the massive power differential between crew and antagonists, consider what the crew is able to feasibly dealwith, especially on lowpop rounds. Disabling the shields when the crew consists of a medical doctor and the club manager would be considered poor form. 

* On the other side, the entire crew versus one antagonist may drown out attempts to roleplay- Unless it's your job, or your survival, you shouldn't be hunting down antagonists.
<br>

3. If you're an antag you should stop a moment to think about the why's/how's of your plan and ahelp to ask for ideas if you're stuck. Nothing is more dull and frustrating to the round than 'I don't know, I just had this funny PDA app one day'. People also are encouraged to set up exploitative information in their character setup. This can be used for hooks as well.
<br>

4. ERP is allowed. ERP is not the focus of the server. Disregarding your duties to get laid will result in disciplinary action. Don’t do anything you aren’t comfortable with the ghosts seeing. Ghosts, don’t LOOC at horny people.
<br>

5. Try not to do other people’s jobs while they are able and willing.
<br>
