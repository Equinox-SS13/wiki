# Gun and Armaments

## Mechanisms

There are many types of guns, each working differently; either by changing the type of reload, fire mode, and standard caliber. Different gun mechanisms make the resulting gun work differently. 

This page will only cover ballistics, since energy and laser guns cannot be crafted in typical means, requiring disks and autolathe, hand-crafting, or the protolathe.
* Ballistics are a type of weapon firing traditional and conventional physical round. These rounds are usually loaded with gunpowder and triggered by a firing pin. 
* This causes a chambered explosion as the bullet leaves the barrel. This results in a loud "bang", recoil, and bright flash.

    <tr>
      <td> Self-loading </td>
      <td> Standard for semi-automatic or automatic carbine, rifles, and maskman rifle, takes magazines and rarely stripper clips. </td>

    	<tr>
      <td> Machine Gun </td>
      <td> Fast-firing carbine or rifle caliber, usually inaccurate with heavy recoil build up. Some takes magazines, others are belt-fed and require the opening of the top reciever using another hand. </td>

   	<tr>
      <td> Bolt-action </td>
      <td> Requires you to work the bolt before firing a shot by activating in hand. Reserved for maskman rifle, sniper rifles, and anti-material rifles due to the accuracy. Some are magazine fed, though many uses stripper-clip or individual round. </td>
  	</tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Shotgun </td>
      <td> Unless semi-automatic or automatic, requires the racking of the gun before another round can be fired by activating in hand. Takes 20mil rounds, shotgun takes individual rounds and rarely magazines.  </td>
  	</tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Break Action </td>
      <td> Although not a mechanism itself, break action guns equires you to use the gun in hand to open it, cracking it in half to eject casing and reload new ammo. </td>
  	</tr>

* **Note:** To use the gun in-hand, either press Z while holding the gun in your active/highlighted hand (if in Hotkey Mode), or click on the gun while holding it in your active/highlighted hand (Works for both modes).

# Gun Crafting
To craft a gun, it requires parts. Gun parts can be manufactured, bought, traded for, or found in maintenance trash piles. Armament piles increases the chance to contain these gun parts.

* **Gun Disassembly**: A way to convert or repurpose gun by breaking it down to gun parts. This can be done using `wire-cutting` tool on the gun, with a chance of breaking certain parts if `Mechanical` stat is too low.
* **Gun Sawing**: Using any `sawing` tool, most guns can be shortened for easy storage at the cost of reducing its recoil control and accuracy.
* **Serial Number**: All guns have serial number that can be traced back using [bullet forensics](). A gun's serial number can, however, be removed using a `bolt-turning` tool.

## Gun Parts
Every gun are composed of and have four required parts:
1. A frame: The basis for the gun that you attach the other three parts to. One frame can be used to make many different guns depending on the parts you put on it. The difference might be as simple as a different grip! 
2. A barrel: The thing the bullets come out of. A barrel's caliber tells you the type of ammo that the gun takes.
3. A grip: The thing you're supposed to hold on to. Helps determine what gun your frame will make, if it has multiple options. 
4. A mechanism: The thing that actually makes the bullets fire. Determines the action of the gun.

Parts can be stored in Gun Part Lockers, these are located in a few departments and maintenance. Parts are usually manufactured using disks and more commonly found in trash piles.

### The Nanite Reconstitution Apparatus

Within Marshal Armory and Supply Specialist's reach, the Nanite Reconstitution Apparatus is a machine used to repair or reconstruct damaged guns and gun parts using nanites and material.

Additionally, the Nanite Reconstitution Apparatus can reclaim material from gun part, breaking it down into steel, plasteel, wood, and plastic.
* This can be done by inserting the gun or gun part into the machine and clicking deconstruct, the material can be then unloaded from the machine like the Autolathe.

## Crafting Steps

To craft a gun, first find a frame. Then, slap parts into it until you've filled the slots! Examine the frame to see what parts are currently installed. 
* If you've added a part that you don't want, hit the frame with a screwdriver to remove a part. Note that parts must be appropraite for the gun for it to be able to be put into the frame. 
* See the list of the recipes below to see what parts are needed for what specific guns, but in general, the type of part goes with the type of gun. For example, revolvers need revolver mechanisms, shotguns need shotgun barrels, etc. 

Once you've added all three parts, pick up the gun frame and use the gun frame in hand by pressing Z (in Hotkey mode) or clicking onto the gun when it's in the active/highlighted hand.

This will finish the gun and turn it into a finished copy of the gun the frame names. For example, finishing a Regulator frame will turn it into a Regulator.

# Frame Crafting Recipes

The following is a series of tables listing recipes for crafting guns by adding parts to frames by gun type.

## Handcrafted Guns

Some guns can't be made through the frame crafting system even though the frame can be found. To make these guns, open the [Crafting Menu](/guides/other-guides/Crafting#armaments) and follow the instructions to create the gun you want to craft. 
* The recipe there includes both the instructions to follow and the materials you'll need to make the gun, so they aren't listed here to save space. 

# Ammunition
Within the realms of ballistics, conventional gunpowder-filled brass casing tipped with lead projectile is used as ammunition. Different caliber of ammunition work differently, and within each caliber, specialized types exist.

## Ammunition Manufacturing
Ammunition can be acquired in many ways, though creating them yourself is more challenging.

* **Handcrafted scrap ammo**: through the use of [crafting](/guides/other-guides/Crafting), one can make a `scrap ammo kit` which allow creation of ammunition scaling with your `mechanical` skill.
* **Design Disk**: through an autolathe, with the right disk one can fabricate ammunition using material and/or design point.
* **Bullet Fabricator**: Marshal's special, upgradable bullet fabricator that can build boxes, magazines, and exotic material using any types of material or matter cartridges.
* **Protolathe**: certain type of ammunition such as lasers and soporific can only be manufactured through Science's Protolathe.
* **Guild Crafting Station**: Guild has a crafting station that can manufacture and produce ammunition, though not as efficient and limited in selection compared to the Marshal's bullet fabricator.

## Caliber
Caliber refers to the size of the bullet with the in-game measurement in milimeter in width and height. 
* The larger the caliber means the harder the impact, and the longer the caliber means the faster the bullet travel (velocity), both causing more damage and penetrating armor as well as recoil.

<br>

| Caliber | Detail |
| - | - |
| 9mm Pistol (.35) | Standard pistol and smg ammunition, smallest of all with petty firepower and recoil.
| 10mm Magnum (.40) | Magnum round for magnum revolver, pistol, and some rifles. Hits relatively hard with more penetration.
| 12mm Kurtz (.50) | Heavy kurtz round for heavy pistol. Hits extremely hard with a kick, but without a lot of velocity.
| 6.5mm Carbine (.257) | Small carbine rifle round, despite being smaller, the high velocity means it can pack punch through armor despite smaller caliber.
| 7.62mm Rifle | Standard rifle round, balanced between firepower, penetratioon, and recoil. A powerhouse of any combat group.
| 20mm Shotgun | Standard, large shotgun round for breaching and CQC purposes.
| 10x24mm Caseless | A 10mm caseless round for use of SMGs and rifles, produce no casing.
| 5.56mm (.223) | Special laser-only caliber specifically used in science-manufactured weapons.
| .223 Piezoelectric | Pulse-charged laser previously used for pulse-based rifles, no longer used though can be found normally.
| 14.5mm Anti-Material | Anti-material round for Anti-Material Rifles, used to punch through multiple walls and armor.
| 17.7mm Rolled Shot | An even stronger AMR round for the Baroque lever-action and Mercurian Anti-Atmos rifle.


## Ammunition Type

### Standard Rounds
Common, general ammunition type designed to be used everyday by law enforcement, militia, military, and pirates.

| Ammunition | Caliber | Detail |
| - | :-: | - | 
| FMJ / Ball | 6.5mm, 7.62mm, 8.6mm | A standard lethal lead projectile for rifle caliber and up.
| High-Velocity (HV) | 9mm, 10mm, 12mm, 6.5mm | High-Velocity round that allow for higher penetration on any armor, generally less damaging due to the nature of the round not causing fragmentation.
| APSD | 7.62mm | 7.62mm special High-Velocity penetrating round, packs more piercing than standard HV.
| SLAP | 8.6mm | 8.6mm Saboted Light Armor Penetrator spoon-tipped core made to shred through armor.
| Hollow-Point (HP) | 9mm, 10mm, 12mm, 6.5mm, 7.62mm, 8.6mm | A soft round designed to expand once it hits the target, causing nasty injury. However, it is useless against armored target with barely any penetration.
| Slug | 20mm | Shotgun round loaded with a single sabot designed for medium range penetration.
| Buckshot | 20mm | Shotgun round loaded with smaller pebbles designed to spread after fired. Very weak against armor but effective close-range.
| Beanbag | 20mm | The rubber round version of the 20mm shotgun round, very painful.
| Rubber | All | These soft-hitting rubber round are designed to cause pain to the target. Not intended to cause damage though not completely harmless, it is a choice for law enforcement for detaining threats. Useless against armored targets.
| Pepperball | 9mm, 10mm, 12mm, 6.5mm, 20mm | Pepperballs are capsaicin rounds designed to cause pain and discomfort to the target. Impact injects capsaicin, it means that the round is more effective if the target are not completely armored or sealed.
| Practice / Blank | All | Practice or blank rounds for training, does no damage and is safe.
| Scrap | All including 14.5mm | Makeshift crafted ammo from scrap ammo kit, worse than actual fabricated ammunition but better than nothing.
* *All refers to all the ammunition type except the following; 10x24 caseless, 5.56mm, 14.5mm, 17.7mm.*
<br>

### Special Rounds
These are rounds that most will not come across, either because it is faction-specific or special use case.

| Ammunition | Caliber | Detail |
| - | :-: | - | 
| Incendiary | 6.5mm, 7.62mm, 8.6mm, 20mm | This type of ammunition is designed to light up and set the target on fire.
| Caustic / Biomatter | 9mm, 10mm, 20mm | Caustic caseless made to destroy any flesh-being without biohazard protection. Melts the skin from the inside with acid burns. Exclusive to Church.
| Laser | Any including 5.556mm | Cartridges designed to hold chemical which, when activates, fire out a laser projectile just like a lasgun capable of going through windows. Exclusive to Science.
| Ceramic | 20mm | Shotgun round with compact ceramic material inside to act like slugs. Knocks the target back one tile, worse than slugs in every other aspects.
| Illumination | 20mm | Shotgun rounds that light up the area, works as a flare.
| Taser | 20mm | Shotgun round firing taser bolt that shocks the target on hit, non-lethal.
| Plasma / Heavy Plasma | 20mm | Shotgun rounds that are designed to fire plasma projectile, works similarly to the Church's plasma weaponry except in a cartridge.
| Soporific | 9mm, 10mm, 7.62mm, 20mm | These rubber ammunition are coated with [Soporific]() designed to dose the target up until they inevitably fall unconscious. Exclusive to Science.
| Condensed Soporific | 9mm | Like normal Soporific rounds, but these plastic rounds are more effective in dosage injection than normal. Exclusive to the CBO.
| Armor Penetration (AP) | 14.5mm | Standard AMR round for general use against all targets overall for piercing through things and buildings.
| "Red-Nose" | 14.5mm | AMR round built specifically to make large holes in organics with more damage and pain.
| "Off-Switch" | 14.5mm | Ion round for the AMR, causes EMP burst to the target where the round is impacted.
| "Willy-Pete" | 14.5mm | White phosphorous incendiary round for the AMR, packs much less punch but causes the target to burn.

## Others

Other types of ammunition for ballistics and exotic weapons usually made by the bullet fabricator and other machinery.

| Ammunition | Detail |
