# Gun Crafting Basics

If you can't buy, trade, or scrounge for guns, you could always craft them. To craft a gun, it requires parts. Gun parts can be bought, traded for, or found in maintenance trash piles. Armament piles have more chance to have these.

If you have guns you don't want to use, you can hit them with a wrench on help intent to dissassemble a gun into its component parts.

# Parts
Guns have four required parts:
- A frame
- A barrel
- A grip
- A mechanism

## Frames

Frames are the base required parts to make a gun. Without a frame, you can't even get started.

A table listing frames is below:



## Barrels

Barrels determine the caliber of ammo that a gun fires. 

A table listing barrels is below:

## Grips

Grips are the thing you use to hold the gun.

A table listing grips is below:

## Mechanisms

Mechanisms are the fiddly mechanical bits in the gun. 

A table listing mechanisms is below:

# Crafting

To craft a gun, first find a frame. Then, slap parts into it until you've filled the slots! Examine the frame to see what parts are currently installed. If you've added a part that you don't want, hit the frame with a screwdriver to remove a part. Note that parts must be appropraite for the gun. See the list of the crafting recipes to see what parts are needed for what specific guns, but in general, the type of part goes with the type of gun. For example, revolvers need revolver mechanisms, shotguns need shotgun barrels, etc. 

Once you've added all three parts, pick up the gun and do the following depending on if you're in hotkey mode or not.

- If you're using hotkeys, press Z. 
- If you're not using hotkeys, click on the gun in your hand while it is in your active hand.

This will finish the gun and turn it into a finished copy of the gun the frame names. For example, finishing a Regulator frame will turn it into a Regulator.

# Recipes
