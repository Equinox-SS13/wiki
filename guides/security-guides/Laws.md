# Space Law

Space Law, Corporate Regulations, Company Mandates, Oragnaizational Rules. Whatever name you use for a collection of group regulations, everyone is bound by a collection of standardized rules and regulations. As [[INSERT JOB TITLE HERE]], your job is to ensure that these are followed and punish people who are not following them. 

The Regulations are broken up into levels of severity. Less severe crimes are punished more leniently than higher severity crimes. The descriptions of the crimes are not meant to be exclusive, and activity that is similar to one of the below crimes should be charged as that crime, within reason. See the following table for average sentencing guidelines.

# Definitions

Space law uses a set of definitions to make it more readable and generally easier to follow. These are as follows:

- Purposeful/Purposefully: Acting with the result of the action being the intended consequence of the action. For example, pulling the trigger on a gun intending to shoot the captain is purposefully killing the captain.
- Knowing/Knowingly: Acting with the knowledge that a consequence of an action is a likely or guaranteed result of the action. For example, possession of a deadly weapon or explosive. Also covers willful blindness, where the person intentionally tries to prevent their knowledge of a situation or circumstance likely to result in unlawful or harmful action.  
- Reckless/Recklessly: Deliberate and unjustifiable conscious disregard for possible consequences of an action. For example, operating a mech while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
- Negligent/Negligently: Unreasonable lack of knowledge of the possible consequences of an action. Sometimes described as "Didn't know, but should have." For example, letting an unidentified assistant into a secure department area.
