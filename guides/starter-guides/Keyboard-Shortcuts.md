# Keyboard Hotkeys

Space Station 13 comes with two major control options; legacy and hotkey.
* Legacy control is the default control. In this mode, the game respond to commands using the `arrow keys`, using mouse clicks, and the legacy chat bar beneath the chat box to type out actions.
* Hotkey control can be activated by pressing `TAB` key, removing your pointer from the legacy chat bar and enabling hotkey mode. Here you can use a multitude of keys to perform actions.


## Hotkey-mode Controls
These are hotkey-mode specific controls, requiring the activation of the mode using `TAB` to function.

  |		TAB			|	Toggle hotkey-mode	|		F11					| Toggle fullscreen
| 	W				| Up										|		Q						|	Drop held item
|		A				| Left									|		E						| Equip held item / unholster weapon from suit slot

| Shift + E | Equip to bag					| Alt + Click| Access storage / Alternative interaction / Firemode Toggle 
| Shift + Q | Equip to suit storage	| Shift + B			| Equip to belt

## Normal Hotkey Controls
This does not require the hotkey mode to be on, which means that this works by default with the legacy control mode.

|	Ctrl + W  |	Up										|	Ctrl + Q			| Drop held item
|	Ctrl + A	| Left									|	Ctrl + E			| Equip
|	Ctrl + S	|	Down									|	Ctrl + R			|	Toggle throw mode
|	Ctrl + D	| Right									|	Ctrl + X			| Swap Hand
|	Ctrl + Y	| Whisper								|	Ctrl + Z 			| Activate held object
| Ctrl + 1	| Sets help-intent			|	Ctrl + F			| Cycle intents counter clockwise
| Ctrl + 2  | Sets disarm-intent		| Ctrl + G			| Cycle intents clockwise
| Ctrl + 3  | Sets disarm-intent		| DEL						| Stops pulling
