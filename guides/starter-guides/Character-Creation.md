# Guide to Character Creation
This guide will walk you through the character creation menu so that you can start playing the game. 

# A Note on Roleplay

Equinox is a roleplay server first and a gameplay server second. This doesn't mean that gameplay isn't important. Instead it means that you should, first and foremost, be playing a believable character. Put some thought into who your Spaceperson is and you'll have a good time.

# The Character Screen
There are nine tabs in the character creation process: General, Augmentation, Background, Occupation, Roles, Matchmaking, Loadout, Global, and Laws. Just above these tabs are five buttons: Load Slot, Save Slot, Reset Slot, Reload Slot, and Copy Slot. Load, Save, and Reset each Load another character slot, Save the current slot, and Reset the current slot to random respectively. Reload slot reloads the slot. Copy slot copies it to another slot. These options are always available regardless of what tab you are on. 

## General
When you first open the character creation menu, you will be placed on the General tab. To make your character, you will need to edit a randomly generated character. 
![general_character_screen_new.png](/general_character_screen_new.png)
At the top left is the name area. Choose a name! You can also have it randomized each round if you want. 

Below that is the general information area. Your species name can be changed unless you set your species to a non-human species below. You can also set your sex, gender, age, blood type, whether or not you need glasses, and the location you spawn in if you join the round after it begins. 

Below that is the body area. The (R) button randomizes your body settings. Your species selection dictates some starting [stats](/guides/starter-guides/Stats-and-Skills) and [perks](/guides/other-guides/Perks) as well as available marking options. Your form is your overall look, determining some body shape options without your custom markings. Scale changes the size of your sprite slightly. 

On the bottom left are the flavor text and notes. Please write a general physical description of your character, including but not limited to height, appearance, build, hair and eye color, and other visible characteristics. Flavor text is shown when someone examines you, and robot flavor text is shown if you are a cyborg and someone examines you. OOC notes are for notes on roleplay you are seeking, if you need help, or any other out-of-character comments you want to make on your character. 

On the top right is the basic equipment menu. Here you select your underclothes and the appearance of the backpack you have. As a note, duffel bags have to be put on the ground to be opened but have lots of storage space. Backpacks need to be held or placed down to be opened and have a little less storage than the duffel bag. Satchels and messenger bags have less storage space than backpacks or duffel bags but can be opened when on your back. 

Below that, your blood color determines the color of your blood when you bleed. The rest of the right side is dedicated to markings. These are displayed on your character to allow you to make whatever you'd like! 

## Augmentation

On the Augmentation screen, you can edit your limbs, organs, and internal implants. 
![augmentation_character_screen_new.png](/augmentation_character_screen_new.png)
To augment an organ or limb, click the associated organ or limb and then click the option you want on the left side. This left side menu will not show up until you select an organ or limb, so don't worry if you can't see it at first.

Your core implant is a big choice. You have three selections:
1. A [Cruciform](). Having a Cruciform locks you to playing jobs in [the Church]() (and is the only way to play jobs in the church), but gives you the ability to perform powers called Litanies. They come in a variety of types, each having a different focus within the Church. Read the Church guide for more information on these types!
2. A [Psionic Organ](guide/other-guides/Psionics). This can either be a normal organ or an augmented organ. The normal organ can be used on any non-Church job, but the augmented organ locks you to playing Psychiatrist, but is much more powerful. See the Psionics guide for more information on Psionics.
3. A [Nanogate](). Nanogates are spinal replacements that contain a slurry of nanites. This can be used to gain special powers specific to Nanogates, but your insight gain is cut by a *huge* 60%, meaning that you'll level up only 40% as fast as other people. See the [Guide to Sanity and Insight](/guides/starter-guides/Sanity-and-Insight) for more information on leveling up and insight gain.

## Background

The next tab covers background information: Character Records, Background, and other information! 

![background_character_screen_new.png](/background_character_screen_new.png)
### Languages
You get two languages. The first is locked to English Common. The second is selectable from a list. Pick something that your character would likely know! 
### Records
The Records section covers your Medical, Employment, and Security records. Think of this as your character's history. Fill out some basic information in these fields. If you need help, feel free to ask! Good information to put here includes medical allergies, physical history, and prior surgeries for medical records, prior employment positions, demerits, and promotions for employment records, and any run-ins with security, cops, or other concerning information for security records. Your character's memory is for you to put things your character would remember. You don't have to fill this out, but if you want to remember something, put it in here! It will be included in your character's memory at the start of every round.
### Background
The background section contains four categories: Career, Ethnicity, Homeworld, and Upbringing. Each of these subsections provides additional stat bonuses and perks. The bonuses for each will be listed below. For a detailed explanation of Stats, see the [Guide to Stats](/guides/starter-guides/Stats-and-Skills), and for more informaition on Perks, see the [Guide to Perks](/guides/other-guides/Perks). Each selection will have some information on what you receive when you select it as well.

### Skills
You also have 15 Stat Points to put towards editing your skills even more. You can adjust your skills from -10 to 15, and you gain one additional point for each point you assign a stat below zero. For example, setting your BIO to -10 gives you 10 additional points. 

COG costs only 1/2 skill point per level, so setting your COG to 15 will take 8 points (7.5 rounded up). ANA costs 5 points per level, so reducing your ANA by 1 will grant you another 5 points, and raising it by 1 will cost 5 points. 

## Occupation

![occupation_character_screen_new.png](/occupation_character_screen_new.png)
This screen allows you to pick your jobs on roundstart! Click a job's title to potentially access alternate job titles and click the [?] box for more information, including job stats and perks. 

The game takes your preferences in the following order. If you have a Low Priority job set, the game will try and place you in any open Medium Priority jobs first. If you have any High Priority jobs set, the game will try and place you in those jobs before trying for Medium Jobs. Selecting NEVER will never place you in that job. If you have any Command jobs set, those will be considered before any other jobs you have set to the same priority. You can set any number of jobs to medium 
and low, and only one job may be set to high. 

Click "Return to lobby if preference unavailable" to select to either return to the lobby if none of your preferences are open, select a random job if none of your preferences are open, or spawn as a Colonist if none of your preferences are available. 

Some jobs are species/implant/age locked. If you see [Setup Restricted], you need to change your implants to access that job. [Age Restricted] means you need to change your character's age. [Species restricted] means you need to change your species. 

## Roles
![roles_character_screen_new.png](/roles_character_screen_new.png)

On this page, you set your availability for antagonist roles. On the left, select "Yes" if you want to be considered for each type of antagonist, and select "Never" if you do not want to be selected. Please see the [Guide to Antagonists]() for explanations of each role. 

The right side of the screen provides your Antagonist Uplink prority. The uplink will try and place your uplink in the top option first, then the middle, then the bottom.

Exploitable information is information available to any antagonists who wish to check it. This is a good place to put Roleplay Hooks for antagonists to use, like family members, vulnerabilities of your character (emotional or physical), and more! 

## Matchmaking
![matchmaking_character_screen_new.png](/matchmaking_character_screen_new.png)

Matchmaking allows you to randomly match with other players to create connections. These are not mandatory, but they can provide an interesting, random dynamic to certain relationships. If you choose to opt in, you will be considered for matching with other people depending on what specific options you opt into. If you do not opt in, you will not be considered for matchmaking. 

## Loadout
![loadout_character_screen_new.png](/loadout_character_screen_new.png)
In the Loadout screen, you select equipment that your character will spawn with. This equipment is in addition to any other equipment you are provided by your job, perks, species, and backgrounds, if available. Each item has a point cost, and you have a total of 10 points across all categories to spend. Some items are locked to certain occupations, and these will be shown by either <span style = "color:red"> red </span> text if unavailable to your current job, or <span style = "color:green"> green </span> text if available. Faction gear is always locked to the associated department. 

## Global
![global_pref_screen_character_new.png](/global_pref_screen_character_new.png)
The global tab alows you to change your global preference settings. On thel eft, you can change your UI style and color, your cient FPS, and your TGUI (another UI style used intermittently, gotta love Space Station 13) theme. you can also change the keys required to do visible, custom, and audible emotes, talk on the radio, and use specific languages.

Your PersonalAI role settings are also found here, and worl like normal character names, descriptions, roles, and OOC notes. 

The right side is dedicated to what you can see, your UI, and a bunch of other options. Please read through them before changing things. 

## Laws
![laws_screen_character_new.png](/laws_screen_character_new.png)
The last tab shows if your species has any laws, and if they do, what they are. This is most often shown when you select the "Cyborg" or "AI" occupations. Otherwise, like above, it will show you that you have no laws. This does not mean you don't have to follow any laws, but that your actions are instead bound by [Space Law](/guides/security-guides/Laws) and not inbuilt restrictions on your behavior. 

# Entering the Game
Once you're satisfied with your character, records, augments, loadout, background, and occupation, click join game! If the round hasn't started yet, the button will instead show a choice between [Ready] and [Not Ready]. Clicking ready will spawn you in the game world once the round starts proper. It also shows the character and job you're playing on the top right of the screen, in the Status tab. Enjoy your round!
