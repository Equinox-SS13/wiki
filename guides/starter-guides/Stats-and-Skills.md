# Overview
Stats are numeric values that signify your character's skill in various areas. Besides being a rough guide to your character's knowledge, they also affect the probability and speed of some actions succeeding or failing, depending on the stat. 

* There are three knowledge stats: `Mechanical`, `Cognition`, and `Biology`. This usually refer to the ability of the person to perform an intellectual task.
* There are three physical stats: `Robustness`, `Vigilance`, and `Toughness`. This usually reflect a person's combat performance or ability to exert themselves in the face of odds.
* Additionally, there are two health-related "skills": `Anatomy` and `Vivification`. These reflect a person's overall healthiness.

These stats can be temporarily altered and raised by [gaining insight and leveling up](/guides/starter-guides/Sanity-and-Insight) and reset at the end of every round. The stats of a character at the start of the round generally determined by their role in the colony combined with their background and species.
* At the [character creation menu](), each species, homeworld, background, and upbringing can be selected to raise or lower your characters stat and [perks]() at the start of the round.
* The role or job of your character determines additional stats and [perks]() received at the start of the round.
* 15 points are also given to a character at the character creation menu. You can assign these points to raise stats, with `Cognition` taking half as much point and `Anatomy` taking 5 points each. Stats can also be lowered to gain additional points.
	* Stats can be negative at round start, whether by selecting a background with negative stat or putting up to -10 into each stat respectively to reassign them somewhere else.
* [Post Revival Sickness]() drastically reduces all stats permanently after being revived from death.

## Stat Level
Within the game, stats and skills are portrayed with more nebulous language without the use of specific [perks]() or other source of information such as the *employment record*.

Additionally, the default max stat level is `150` or `Grand Mastery`, but can be raised further with certain perks.


| - | - | - | - 
| Higher Understanding | > 200 | - | - 
| Theoretical Understanding | > 150 | Basic | > 15
| Grand Mastery | > 120 | Untrained | > 7
| Skill Mastery | > 100 | Misinformed | < -1
| Mastery | > 80 | Inept | < -15
| Proficient | > 60 | Incompetent | < -20
| Expert | > 40 | Blundering | < -50
| Adept | > 25 | Hopeless | <-100 |{.no-table-head}

# Stat

Each stat is used for different things. The uses for each stat, both generally and at high levels, are explained below.

## Mechanical (MEC)
All things mechanical, building, and fixing.

### General Use
| - | - | 
| Mechanical Tools | Anything requiring a tool, such as wrenching, screwdriving, etc. Additionally makes the tools last longer.
| Crafting | Appliances, airlocks, furnitures, modifications, and even [working with and repairing guns]().
| Robot and Mech | Maintaining, crafting, repairing, and operating on robots and mechs.
| Construction | Boosts the chance of success and speed of repairs, disassembling, and construction.
| Modification | Boosts the chance of success and speed of modifying and removing modifications from tools and guns.
| Tool Quality | Raises the quality of the tool depending on the level of the stat.
| Prosthetic Repairs | Boosts the chance of success and speed of prosthetic repairs and surgery 
| Machine Operation | Allows operating specific machinery like the Matter NanoForge, Bullet Fabricator, and Exosuit Fabricator. |{.no-table-head}

### Special Use
* At high enough level, allows identifying what each wire does on a given machine or airlock.
* Allows removing safeties out of a hardsuit on a person by using drilling tool on their chest while they're buckled to the bed to allow for quick removal of the hardsuit or RIG.
* Increasing the odds of finding additional mats when dissasembling machines for those with a [perk oriented on salvage]() (`COG` also helps with this)

## Cognition (COG)
Everything technological and smart, or practical and general.

### General Use
| - | - | 
| Computing Devices | Allows reparing, hacking, and operating computing devices and their programs, this also includes some specific consoles like the DNA modifier console, R&D console, or various science tools.
| Crafting | Computers, computer parts, and various other tools and weapons. Includes simple assemblies igniters and timers.
| Medical Equipment | Allows using medical machines and equipment such as the chemical dispensers, body scanner, health scanner, syringes, etc.
| Pulsing Tools | Faster and better chance of tools with pulsing quality like the multitool. Allowing better chances of disarming active mines and hacking locks.
| [Psionics](/guides/other-guides/Psionics) | If you are a Psion, it increases your maximum Psi Points and your Cognitive Potential (Psi points regeneration)
| Drone Repairs | Full repair of a non-functional (dead) Nanobot from a Nanogate implant, or Custom-made Drones using multitool.
| Genetics | Allows the use of Xenogenetics machines like the Xenofauna Genetics Pulper. At higher level allows the use of Vat Control Console, Belvoix Genetic Analyzer, and Belvoix Xenofauna Cloning Vat.
| Tripping | Reducing your chance of tripping on underplating if running (`VIG` also helps with this).
| Tinkering | Success chance on tinkering with grenades to change timer, calibration of hand-teleporter, and even using Bluespace Harpoon. |{.no-table-head}

### Special Use
* Speeds up the process of collecting spider silk using a silk weaver.
* Allows cutting hair out of wet leather to prepare for tanning.
* Success chance on collecting items from inside Strange Rocks found in Xenoarcheology when using a tool of Welding quality on them.
* Success chance on using a tool with Excavating quality on a Rocky Debris, and finding stuff through Xenoarcheology in this way.
* Increasing the odds of finding additional mats when dissasembling machines for those with a [perk oriented on salvage]() (`MEC` also helps with this)

## Biology (BIO)
Knowledge of the body and its inner workings.

| - | - | 
| Medical Equipment | Allows using medical machines and equipment such as the chemical dispensers, body scanner, health scanner, syringes, etc.

## Vivification (VIV)
DRUGS! Both pharmeceutical and "pharmeceutical". 

Vivification directly increases your NSA (Neural Systems Accumulation), which directly affects how many drugs you can take at the same time without having side effects. Both pharmeceutical drugs like bicardine, tricordizine, and dylovene AND street drugs like cherry drops, space drugs, and mindbreaker toxin add to your NSA.

## Anatomy (ANA)
Take a beating. 

Each point in Anatomy increases your maximum health.
> As of August 23, 2024, Anatomy is currently bugged and is only increasing your maximum health by one point per point of Anatomy.
