# Guide to Sanity
Equinox code, because it's based on Eris/Sojurncode, has a rather in-depth sanity system. This is represented by a HUD icon on the right side of your screen.

# Sanity
## Gaining Sanity
Your sanity regenerates slowly over time. However, you can influence its regeneration through your actions and your environment. Clean and brightly lit areas don't necessarily raise your sanity any faster, but they stop it from decreasing as quickly. 

You can actively gain sanity through a variety of means. Most of these are things that feel nice to do, such as eating food, drinking drinks (especially alcoholic ones), and talking to people. Other things like passive mobs (cows, cats, chickens, etc.) and holoplants and decorations can passively increase your sanity gain over time. Smoking also slowly increases your sanity. Certain church powers, psionic powers, or perks can also increase your sanity or make regaining it easier.

Sometimes you may receive a personal objective. These appear in your notes. Completing this objective will reward you with 20 insight points, plus whatever other reward the objective offers. See the [[Objectives]] page for more information.

## Losing Sanity

Sanity is lost in a variety of ways. Taking damage or feeling pain will drain sanity based on the amount of damage you've taken in that hit or the amount of pain you're feeling. Being in dirty areas, especially areas covered in blood or gibs, also drains your sanity at a rate proportional to how dirty the room is. Darkness also causes slow sanity loss. Seeing someone near you die also causes sanity loss, unless you have the Nihilist perk. 

Sanity loss from body damage (brute and burn) is less than that caused by psionic damage or effects, which is less than that caused by seeing a dead body, which is less than that caused by shock damage. 

You can mitigate sanity loss directly by having a higher Vigilance stat.

# Breakdowns
Sanity can be lost down to 40% before you start seeing negative effects. Once you hit 40% sanity, you will start to hallucinate. You'll start hearing things, then seeing things. The lower your sanity is below 40%, the more frequent these will be come. 

If your sanity hits zero, you'll suffer a breakdown. Breakdowns represent the stress of whatever you've experienced becoming too much for you, and your character will react in some way.

Breakdowns come in three flavors, positive, neutral, and negative. Unmodified, the chance for a positive breakdown is 20% and the chance for a negative is 30%. Certain perks can modify this chance. 

## Positive Breakdowns
Positive breakdowns will show up in blue, bold text in your chatbox. All positive breakdowns restore 100 sanity on firing. Below is a list of positive breakdowns, their effects, duration, and display text.

Use this to roleplay as best you can!
| Power Hungry | Reduces your electrical resistance to 0 (Siemens coefficient) and makes you want to receive an electric shock. | 15 Minutes | Wanting to receive an electric shock, pain and numbness and wanting to feel something. | Successfully being shocked grants 20 insight, restores 80 Sanity regardless of if the shock occurred.
| Glassification | Forces you to see through other people's point of view. | 2 Minutes | Your mind expands. |  Restores 40 Sanity on completion.


# Insight

However, losing sanity isn't all bad. When you lose sanity, you gain Insight. Once you've gained at least 100 Insight, you receive Desires and are prompted to rest.

## Desires and Resting

[[rest text here]]

Once you've started resting, you gain Resting Insight. This is tracked by the bottom bar on the Sanity HUD. An easy way to tell if you've started resting is that you've received the text at the start of this section in your chat and you have desires listed above the Insight bar on the sanity HUD. 

[[SHOW INSIGHT BAR]]

Above this bar are your Desires. Doing anything that raises sanity will raise your Insight bar, but fulfilling your Desires raises it a whopping ***sixteen times*** faster. 

Your Desires will come in four types: Food, Drink, Drugs, and Exercise. Fulfilling each of these is rather simple. Eat, drink, or take the type of Food, Drink, or Drug your desire tells you to. Exercise is fulfiled by doing exercise on any of the machines in the gym. When you fill the bar, you gain one Resting Point and can level up.

# Leveling Up

Regardless of whether you fulfil yur desires or not, once you've filled your Insight bar you can level up. Leveling up gives you three choices: Focus on an Oddity, Convert your Insight for Later Use, or Internalize. If you want to store your level up for later, **convert your insight.** As of Aug 22, 2024, SojCode treats the "cancel" option as the "Internalize" option, so cancelling will do the same thing. 

## Focusing on an Oddity - Look at Something Weird

When you select the Focus on an Oddity option, the game will prompt you to select one of the oddities that you're carrying to use as a focus. You will then gain a number of stat points in each stat that the oddity has listed proportional to that stat's strength on the oddity and the number of Resting Points you have stored. You will also gain the Oddity's accompanying perk as well. 

See the Oddities page for more information on oddities. 

## Converting your Insight - MORE POWER

When you choose to Convert your Insight, you simply gain one Resting Point. This will make the next level up more powerful if you choose the Focus on an Oddity or Internalize options.

This choice stacks. If you choose to Convert twice in a row, you will have an additional 2 Resting Points the next time you complete a Rest, one from the first choice and another from the second. 

## Internalizing - Stats without an Oddity

When you Internalize your Experiences, you level up your stats. This functions much like Focusing on an Oddity, but without the oddity. You will not gain a perk. However, a pool of skill points is created, 15 skill points per Resting Point you have. Then, for each point, one of your stats is increased by three. These are chosen randomly, so it is entirely possible for some stats to not level up and some to level enormously if you choose this option. However, you will likely get a wider stat spread than using an Oddity. You also gain one more stat point per rest than by using an oddity, but they are unfocused.

All stats but Anatomy can be raised by Internalizing.

When in doubt, focus an oddity for specific stats, especially if it's strong, and internalize for a wider stat spread. 

### Leveling Up Examples
#### Example 1 - Leveling Up with 1 Resting Point:
Lavar levels up once and chooses to Internalize. Since he has not Converted his insight beforehand, he has one resting point stored up. This means his skill point pool is 15, and once they are randomly assigned, this is the result. 2 Skill Points in Biology, 3 Skill Points in Cognition, 1 Skill Point in Mechanical, 0 Skill Points in Toughness, 5 skill Points in Robustness, 2 Skill Points in Vigilance, and 2 Skill Points in Vivification. This means his Bio will grow by 6, Cog by 9, Mec by 3, Tgh by 0, Rob by 15, Vig by 6, and Viv by 6.

This would work the same way if leveling once by focusing an oddity. For example, Lavar has an oddity that has strength 1 in Biology, 6 in Robustness, and 4 in Cognition. (The exact values of each oddity stat are obfuscated. See the Oddity page.) the oddity will increase each listed stat by two points per strength in the stat. One level up will then give Lavar 2 points in Bio, 12 in Rob, and 8 in Cog. He will also gain the Oddity's perk if it has one. 

#### Example 2 - Leveling Up after Converting
Anais has converted her insight two times before choosing to level up. This time she has Converted her insight twice. This means that her skill point pool is 45, 15 from this rest, 15 from the previous, and 15 from the rest before that. This will result in the same process as Example One above, but with many more points, increasing her overall stats by a total of 135 points. 

This works the same as an oddity. The same Oddity as in Example One (1 Bio, 6 Rob, 4 Cog) will increase her stats by two points per strength in each of the oddity's stats, but this time this will be multiplied by three, because she has three Resting Points (one for this rest, two stored from the previous.) Therefore, her Bio will increase by 6 (2 base * 1 stat * 3 Resting Points), Rob by 18, and Cog by 12.
