# Guide to Oddities
Oddities are items that are touched by weirdness. They can be used to help raise your stats and gain perks. 

## Oddities

When you're digging through the trash and find a busted lighter, wandering around in maintenance and find a weird book, or locate some strange object in your department, you've found an oddity. Hold onto this until you [level up](/guides/starter-guides/Sanity-and-Insight). 

## Oddity Sources
You can find oddities in three ways. The first way is to purchase, barter, steal, or otherwise qcquire them from someone who has already found one. The other two ways are looting and through departmental/static spawns. 

### Looting

Many oddities can be found in maintenance. 

### Departmental/Static

In addition to randomly generated oddities, there also exist a few static ones. These are listed in the table below.

## Reading Oddities
When an oddity spawns, the description is obfuscated. However, they give you a little bit of information as to what they can do for you. 

### Strength

When you use an oddity to level up, your stats will increase according to the strength of each stat listed on the oddity. See the [Guide to Sanity and Insight](/guides/starter-guides/Sanity-and-Insight) for more information on leveling up. The first part of an oddity's stat description is a word describing the strength of the oddity in general terms. There are five tiers of these descriptors, denoted by color.

The first, and weakest, category of strength descriptors are <span style = "color:blue">blue</span> in color. <span style = "color:blue">Blue</span> to a strength of 1 to 3. A stat with this strength will be described as weak, light, subtle, or similar. 

The second weakest category of strength descriptors are <span style = "color:green">green</span>. <span style = "color:green">Green</span> corresponds to a strength of 3 to 6. Stats with this strength will be described as medium, moderate, unremarkable, or similar.

The third category of strength descriptors are <span style = "color:red">red</span>. <span style = "color:red">Red</span> descriptors correspond to a strength of 6 to 10. These strengths will be described as unusual, strong, powerful, or similar. 

The fourth, and second strongest, category of strength descriptors are <span style='color:#d0b050;'>orange</span>. <span style='color:#d0b050;'>Orange</span> stat descriptors correspond with a strength of 10 to 15. This level of strength is described as exceeding, incredible, overwhelming, or similar. 

The fifth and strongest category of strength descriptors are <span style='color:#cd00ff;'>purple</span>. <span style='color:#cd00ff;'>Purple</span> stat descriptors correspond to a strength of 15 or higher. This level of strength is described as cosmic, reality bending, erudite, or similar. 

### Stats

The next thing contained in an oddity's stat description is, apropriately, the stat affected. This too is obfuscated. A table listing the descriptions for each stat is displayed below.

| Stat | Nouns | Adjectives |
|:-----|:------|:-----------|
| Biology | biology, medicine, medical knowledge, anatomy, physiology | skilled at surgery, accustomed to anatomy, knowledgeable in physiology | 
| Cognition | cognition, intelligence, knowledge | smart, intelligent, concentrated, knowledgeable |
| Mechanical | mechanical, tools, crafting, machinery, mechanical restoration | mechanically inclined, accustomed to machinery, proficient at mending machinery, proficient at servicing machinery, capable of repairing gadgets | 
| Robustness | robustness, strength, brawls, fighting | robust, strong |
| Toughness | toughness, resilience, endurance | tough, resilient, endurant (this is a Sojurnism), stoic | 
| Vigilance | vigilance, watchfulness, awareness | vigilant, watchful, aware, wary |
| Vivification | invigoration, vigorous, healthy, fit | vitality, vigor |
| Anatomy | physique, soma, build, frame | morphological, physical | 

> Please note that you cannot level up your Anatomy via oddities. Anatomy is listed in this chart for completeness purposes only.

### Anomalies

The last line of text in an oddity's description is potentially an anomaly. Some oddities might not have anomalies. If one does, however, it will say so at the bottom of the oddity's description in <span style='color:#d0b050;'>orange</span> text. If the strange thing you found has such text, congratulations! The oddity you found has a perk attached. For a full list of perks, please see the
