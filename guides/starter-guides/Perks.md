# Perks
Perks are abilities granted to your character. They are acquired through a variety of methods, including through [Character Creation](/guides/starter-guides/Character-Creation), through [Oddities](/guides/starter-guides/Oddities), and through your [job](jobs main page). Some perks are passive, either activating on a condition or timer or being always active, and some are active, activating only when you tell them to. 

# Character Creation Perks
