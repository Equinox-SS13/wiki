This is where you'll start learning about the current medical system used on Equinox. The code uses a modified Erismed4 with various new medicines and systems to tackle.

# The Basics
It is first and foremost importnat to note that anyone can be stabilized no matter their condition, this is ultimately up to the equipment at hand and the knowledge that you have. Do not beat yourself up over mistakes trying to learn the game!


## Damage Types
There are 4 primary damage types within the game, each can be caused by different afflictions, or as a consequence of less physical means.
* As a general note, the body will naturally heal from these damage, although usually at a very slow pace. More than occasionally, the focus would be to stabilize the patient and stop what is causing the damage.


### Brute
<span style="color: red;">Brute damage</span> are bruising, cuts, lacerations, and pierced wounds. They make up the <span style="color: red;">red</span> number in the medical scanner and can be examined by looking. 

* Brutes are caused by being directly damaged by hostile enemies, stabbed, slashed, or shot at.
* A high enough brute damage may break bones, damage internal organs, or even dismember limbs.
* [Bleeding](https://wiki.bluespace.engineer/en/guides/medical-guides/Guide-to-Medicine#bloodloss) is usually accompanied alongside brute damage, which causes bloodloss.

These are common ways to treat brute damage;
* Using a gauze or brute treatment kit on the affected limb. This also stops bleeding.
* [Tricordizine](), [Bicardine](), and [Meralyn]() can be used to heal brute damage overtime.


### Burn
<span style="color: orange;">Burn damage</span> are burns and peeling skin or scarring wounds. They make up the <span style="color: orange;">orange</span> number in the medical scanner and can be examined by looking.

* Burns are caused by fire, heat, acid burns, or in some case even [radiation](https://wiki.bluespace.engineer/en/guides/medical-guides/Guide-to-Medicine#radiation).
* Burns may cause damage to internal organs, [infection, or even necrosis](https://wiki.bluespace.engineer/en/guides/medical-guides/Guide-to-Medicine#infection).

These are common ways to treat burn damage;
* Using an ointment or burn treatment kit on the affected limb.
* [Tricordizine](), [Kelotane](), and [Dermaline]() can be used to heal burn damage overtime.


### Toxin
<span style="color: lime;">Toxin damage</span> are toxin threshold or the toxicity level of one's blood caused by poisoning. This refers to the <span style="color: lime;">green</span> number in the medical scanner. Toxin are processed overtime, and may worsen or get better depending on whether the patient still has poison in their blood.

Toxins can be caused by different reasons such as;
* Poison caused by being bitten or injected by spiders or other types of fauna.
* Using harmful chemicals, drugs, or overdosing.
* Touching toxic or biohazard substances.
* Breathing in harmful gases such as roach gas or plasma gas.

These are common ways to treat toxin damage;
* The most important aspect is to remove poison, toxic, or harmful substance from the patient's body using [dialysis]() methods, [purging chemicals](), or [stomach pump]()
* [Tricordizine]() or [Arithrazine](), additionally, [Dylovene]() and [Carthatoline]() also purge toxin from the patient's blood.


### Oxyloss
<span style="color: cyan;">Oxyloss</span>, or suffocation, refers to the <span style="color: cyan;">blue</span> number in the medical scanner. This is hypoxia or lack of oxygen to the brain. It is crucial to the patient, as they are truly dead when their brain dies from direct damage or lack of oxygen. 

Oxyloss can be caused by different reasons such as;
* Lack of breathable air in the environment or internal tank.
* Specific poison, toxins, or other chemical effects.
* [Bloodloss aka bleeding](https://wiki.bluespace.engineer/en/guides/medical-guides/Guide-to-Medicine#bloodloss), or lack of blood which disallow oxygen to be transferred to the brain.
* Dead, damaged, or missing lungs, or a lack of heart disallowing blood to be pumped to the brain.

There are a few ways to mediate or treat oxyloss;
* [Inapprovaline]() included in the emergency autoinjector, although this only stop it from going worse.
* [Tricordrazine](), [Dexalin]() and [Dexalin plus](), which treats oxyloss damage, but does not stop what is causing the damage.
* [Stopping bleeding](https://wiki.bluespace.engineer/en/guides/medical-guides/Guide-to-Medicine#bloodloss) and provide [blood transfusion](), repair lungs and relevant organs, removing the toxin in the patient, or making sure the environment is breathable again.
