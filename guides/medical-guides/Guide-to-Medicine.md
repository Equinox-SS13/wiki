# Guide to Medicine
This is where you'll start learning about the current medical system used on Equinox. The code uses a modified Erismed4 with various new medicines and systems to tackle.
> The content of this page is subjected to change as development is currently in the work.

# The Basics
It is first and foremost importnat to note that anyone can be stabilized no matter their condition, this is ultimately up to the equipment at hand and the knowledge that you have. Do not beat yourself up over mistakes trying to learn the game!


## Damage Types
There are 4 primary damage types within the game, each can be caused by different afflictions, or as a consequence of less physical means.


### Brute
<span style="color: red;">Brute damage</span> are bruising, cuts, lacerations, and pierced wounds. They make up the <span style="color: red;">red</span> number in the medical scanner and can be examined by looking. 

* Brutes are caused by being directly damaged by hostile enemies, stabbed, slashed, or shot at.
* A high enough brute damage may break bones, damage internal organs, or even dismember limbs.
* [Bleeding](https://wiki.bluespace.engineer/en/guides/medical-guides/Guide-to-Medicine#bloodloss) is usually accompanied alongside brute damage, which causes bloodloss.

These are common ways to treat brute damage;
* Using a gauze or treatment kit on the affected limb. This also stops bleeding.
* [Tricordizine](), [Bicardine](), and [Meralyn]() can be used to heal brute damage overtime.


### Burn
<span style="color: orange;">Burn damage</span> are burns and peeling skin or scarring wounds. They make up the <span style="color: orange;">orange</span> number in the medical scanner and can be examined by looking.

* Burns are caused by fire, heat, acid burns, or in some case even radiation.
* Burns may cause damage to internal organs, [infection, or even necrosis](https://wiki.bluespace.engineer/en/guides/medical-guides/Guide-to-Medicine#infection).

These are common ways to treat burn damage;
* Using an ointment or treatment kit, alongside gauze on the affected limb.
* [Tricordizine](), [Kelotane](), and [Dermaline]() can be used to heal burn damage overtime.


### Toxin



### Oxyloss
<span style="color: cyan;">Oxyloss</span>, or suffocation, refers to the <span style="color: cyan;">blue</span> number. This is hypoxia or lack of oxygen to the brain. It is crucial to the patient, as they are truly dead when their brain dies from direct damage or lack of oxygen. 

Oxyloss can be caused by different reasons such as;
* Lack of breathable air in the environment or internal tank.
* Specific poison, toxins, or other chemical effects.
* [Bloodloss aka bleeding](https://wiki.bluespace.engineer/en/guides/medical-guides/Guide-to-Medicine#bloodloss), or lack of blood which disallow oxygen to be transferred to the brain.
* Dead, damaged, or missing lungs, or a lack of heart disallowing blood to be pumped to the brain.

There are a few ways to mediate or treat oxyloss;
* [Inapprovaline]() included in the emergency autoinjector, although this only stop it from going worse.
* [Tricordrazine](), [Dexalin]() and [Dexalin plus](), which treats oxyloss damage, but does not stop what is causing the damage.
* [Stopping bleeding](https://wiki.bluespace.engineer/en/guides/medical-guides/Guide-to-Medicine#bloodloss) and provide [blood transfusion](), repair lungs and relevant organs, removing the toxin in the patient, or making sure the environment is breathable again.
