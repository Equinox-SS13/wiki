# Guide to Medicine
This is where you'll start learning about the current medical system used on Equinox. The code uses a modified Erismed4 with various new medicines and systems to tackle.
* This is a quick and detailed breakdown of the system, which is subjected to change as development is currently in the work.

# The Basics
It is first and foremost importnat to note that anyone can be stabilized no matter their condition, this is ultimately up to the equipment at hand and the knowledge that you have. Do not beat yourself up over mistakes trying to learn the game!


## Damage Types
There are 4 primary damage types within the game, each can be caused by different afflictions, or as a consequence of less physical means.

### Brute
Brutes are bruising, cuts, lacerations, and pierced wounds. They make up the red number in the medical scanner and can be examined from the outside. 
* Brutes are caused by being directly damaged by hostile enemies, stabbed, slashed, or shot at.
* A high enough brute damage may break bones, dislocate limbs, or even damage internal organs.
* Bleeding is usually accompanied alongside brute damage, which causes bloodloss.

### Burn
Burns are 

### Toxin


### Oxyloss (Suffocation)
Oxyloss, or suffocation, refers to the blue number. This is hypoxia, lack of oxygen. It is crucial to the patient, as they are truly dead when their brain dies from direct damage or lack of oxygen. Oxyloss can be caused by different reasons such as;
* Lack of breathable air in the environment or internal tank.
* Poison, toxins, or other chemical effects.
* Bloodloss, or lack of blood which disallow oxygen to be transferred to the brain.
* Dead, damaged, or missing lungs, or a lack of heart disallowing blood to be pumped to the brain.

There are only a few ways to treat oxyloss;
* [Inapprovaline]() included in the emergency autoinjector, although this only stop it from going worse.
* [Tricordrazine](), [Dexalin]() and [Dexalin plus](), which treats oxyloss damage, but does not stop what is causing the damage.
* Stop bloodloss and provide blood transfusion, repair lungs and relevant organs, or making sure the environment is breathable again.
