## Damage Types
There are 4 primary damage types within the game, each can be caused by different afflictions, or as a consequence of less physical means.

### Brute
Brutes are bruising, cuts, lacerations, and pierced wounds. They make up the red number in the medical scanner and can be examined from the outside. A high enough brute damage may break bones, dislocate limbs, or even damage internal organs.
