## Basic Medicines
| Name | Recipe | Usage | NSA | Metabolism | Overdose | Notes |
| :--- | :----- | :---- | :-- | :--------- | :------- | :---- |
| Inaprovaline | - 1 part Acetone<br> - 1 part Carbon<br> - 1 part Sugar<br>  | Inaprovaline provides various small affects that help stablize the patient. It provides a little pain relief, reduces oxygen loss slightly, and a slows bleeding slightly. | -5 | 0.1u/s in blood, 0.05u/s in stomach | 60u | ---- |
| Bicardine | - 1 part Inaprovaline<br> - 1 part Carbon<br> - no Sugar<br> | Bicardine heals a decent amount of Brute damage, and slows bleeding. | 15 | 0.2u/s in blood,<br> 0.1u/s in stomach | 30u | ---- |
| Kelotane | - 1 part Silicon<br> - 1 part Carbon<br> | Kelotane heals a decent amount of Burn damage. | 10 | 0.2u/s in blood,<br> 0.1u/s in stomach | 30u | ---- |
| Dylovene | - 1 part Silicon<br> - 1 part Potassium<br> - 1 part Ammonia<br> | Otherwise known as Anti-Toxin, Dylovene's primary function is to heal Toxin damage. It also treats effects from poisons, specifically drowsyness and hallucinations. Finally, it purges out some of the common poisons that are encountered in maintenance. | 0 | 0.2u/s in blood,<br> 0.1u/s in stomach | 30u | If a patient is overdosing, they will recieve "Dylovene Accumilation" wounds in their blood vessels. This type of poisoning is not currently curable outside of replacing the organ entirely. |
| Dexalin | - 2 part Acetone<br> - 0.1 part Iron<br> - 5u Phoron (Catalyst)<br> - no Water<br> | Dexalin heals Oxygen damage, reduces the amount of oxygen loss per tick, and purges Lexorin, a poison that causes oxygen loss.| 5 | 0.2u/s in blood,<br> 0.1u/s in stomach | 30u | ---- |
| Tricordrazine | - 1 part Inaprovaline<br> - 1 part Dylovene<br> | Tricordrazine slowly heals Brute, Burn, Toxin, and Oxygen damages, and slows bleeding slightly. | 15 | 0.2u/s in blood,<br> 0.1u/s in stomach | 30u | Overdosing on Tricordrazine is supposed to deal damage to one's liver and blood vessels, but the function to do so is currently broken. |
| Cryoxadone | - 1 part Dexalin Plus<br> - 1 part Water<br> - 1 part Acetone<br> - Temp from 90c to 45c<br> | As long as the patient's body temperature is below 170 celcius, it will effectively heal all basic forms of damage, slows bleeding, cures infections, and cures benign tumors. The most common way to reach these tempertures is to place the patient in an activated cryopod. | 5 | 0.2u/s in blood,<br> 0.1u/s in stomach | 30u | Cryoxadone affects dead people, allowing cryopods to heal the deceased. |
| Paracetamol | - 1 part Inaprovaline<br> - 1 part Ethanol<br> - 1 part Acetone<br> | Paracetamol provides a good amount of pain reduction. | -10 | 0.1u/s in blood,<br> 0.05u/s in stomach | 60u | Overdosing on Paracetamol will give the patient a drugged visual effect. |
| Tramatol | - 1 part Paracetamol<br> - 1 part Water<br> - 1 part Sugar<br> | Tramatol provides a superior pain relief to Paracetamol. | 40 | 0.1u/s in blood,<br> 0.05u/s in stomach | 30u | Overdosing on Tramatol will give the patient a drugged visual effect, slow them down, and occasionally stun them. |
