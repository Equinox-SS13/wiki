# Perks
Perks are abilities granted to your character. They are acquired through a variety of methods, including through character creation, through [Oddities]((/guides/starter-guides/Oddities), and through your job. Some perks are passive, either activating on a condition or timer or being always active, and some are active, activating only when you tell them to. 

# Character Creation Perks
There are two times in character creation where you can choose your perks. The first is through your species. The second is through your character's background.
