The planet is filled with many friends and foes; some are elusive, some are pets, many are hostile. Certain types are completely harmless, some attack when cornered or provoked, and many are outright wanting to kill you.

For other information or list about humanoid or sentient faction hostile mobs, see [External Threats](/guides/other-guides/External-Threats).

|  | Warrior | The tougher, more painful spider, approach with caution. 
|  | Nurse | The caretaker spider, weaker than the rest, but is responsible for making nests and turning corpses into more spiders. A bite from them can knock out anyone within a matter of seconds. 
|  | Cloaker | A subspecies of the Hunter spiders, Cloakers are just as fast and deadly, although deadlier with their skin enabling them to be nearly invisible, and entirely invisible within the darkness. 
|  | Viper | An evolved Hunter spider in the form of a black widow, it is much faster and stronger than the Hunter spider, running is not a option with this type of spider.
|  | Fortress | A more evolved variant of the Warrior spider, practically a tarantula. Its bites are strong and more capable of breaking bone. Distinguishable by its more heavily armored body. 
|  | Mid Wife | A stronger Nurse spider, it is still responsible for the typical duties of a Nurse spider, however its bite is unique and it injects unstable mutagen into one's system.

|  | Empress | A matriarch of the spiders, the spider queen has the same duties as the Midwife and Nurse, although it reinforces the nest further by laying eggs. Strongest of them all with a bite that injects combat stims, it is not something to easily go against. 
|  | Emperor | Nothing can outrun a Emperor. It is more intelligent than its kin as it can sometimes lay in wait to ambush from the ceiling, knocking its prey down with a shrilling screech. If one is to survive a encounter, get to medical immediately before its venom kills you. 
|  | Reaper | Classified as a leviathan class creature, a furry white and black monster, it strikes fear into the very hearts of the most powerful and stalwart men, capable of taking down even squads of well equipped and trained forces without much difficulty.

|  | Sentinel | A stronger Xenomorph than the Drone. Easy to tell with the green spots on its skin.

|  | Crusher | A behemoth that can knock almost anyone down to the ground in the first charge. It'll crush those bones to dust too if given the chance.

|  | Defiler | A venomous Xenomorph with toxins dripping from its maw and claws. A single strike will make you feel weak and your mind foggy... More will only worsen it.
