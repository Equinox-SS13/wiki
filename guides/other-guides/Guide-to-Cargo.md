# Trading
Cargo's largest duty within the colony is the transportation and sales of freight. As the colonys lifeline towards the outside economy and resources, the most important aspect of the department is trade.

The Trade Beacons allows the colony to import and export goods between them and external stations and ships. 
* The beacon can be accessed via the Trade Program available on consoles and laptops with enough access to a copy from cargo.

## Trade Program
To operate the trade beacon through the Trade Program, the following should be considered in order before performing transactions;

1. Ensure that the sending and receiving beacons are linked, this is usually pre-configured.
2. Link the appropriate account to send or receive money to the program. Any accounts can be used for import purchases and export sales. 
  
   * To request or access historical transactions log, the cargo departmental account will need to be linked.
   * Remember to unlink your account once you are done using the Trade Program unless you want anyone to directly make purchase with your credits.
3. Select the appropriate station or ship on the trading network screen, each with their own specialty, demand, and items on sale.

### Importing Goods
Import purchases can be done by anyone with a bank account through the Trade Program. This is done by first linking an account to the Trade Program and selecting the appropriate partner and viewing the store.

Before a purchase, the item has to be put into a "cart" and a total sum of credits required for purchase displayed. Carts may contain items from several trade partners or saved for repeated use in the future. The purchase is finalized by clicking the checkout button.
