# Planet Lore

-	Planet Location: 
-	Planet Name:

# Colony Lore 

Colony map – 
-	Colony Name:
-	Colony History: 
o	A few factions set up the colony to start making money. They build the colony and before they can really start the operations, the NL crashes in their front yard. 
o	The NL becomes a pseudo gold rush by being a location where factions grab things that they need from in there.
-	Colony Feel:
o	A few smaller spaces. Think large prefab buildings that encompass entire departments.  Not super huge, but usable.
o	More above-ground stuff than underground stuff. 
o	Sort of a murderous Elysium? 
o	Getting that mysterious, vaguely eldritch feel from the events and influence of the light.
	Things from the light coming out to the colony. 
	The Drive is still active and is causing Bluespace fluctuations around the colony. Start small, then go bigger over time.
	Drive itself is nowhere to be found. Chunks of the ship are scattered around the map and teleport in and out between rounds (random generation a la away missions?) 
	Random anomalous ruins start warping in later on, full of random anomalous items and materials to explore, as well as ARG information and information on the NL
	Feeling: Hadley’s Hope but in the daytime?  
	Nothing super elaborate. Prefabs that haven’t had the chance to be realized yet. 
•	Allows for people to help with sort of modular buildings and expansions to the maps. 
o	General Colony Layout: 
	Big prefabs/collections of prefabs that hold departments. Connected by both underground maintenance tunnels and traditional tunnels. 
	NL has absorbed part of the old NTS ship Megumi and crashed in a valley that had been previously set up to be a quarry or mine map south/north of the colony. Not close to the colony but not too far away either. A bit of a trek through the jungle, a little expedition to the expedition site.
