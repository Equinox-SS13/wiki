The Militia, also known as [insert names here], is a complicated topic. Nominally, they protect the colony from the horrors crawling out of what used to be the Northern Light, but they also have retained the mantle of protecting the colony from incursions of other dangerous wildlife. 

# History

[The Planet] is very, very hostile. When the colony was in its planning stages, one of the major questions was how the colony was even supposed to *survive* on a planet where massive, invisible, armored, armor-piercing creatures were a mid-level predator? Simple. You ~~shoot the bast-~~ send in a PMC.

The particular group chosen for this operation was the Paladin Martial Contractor Group, an offshoot of the Paragon Corporation. Paladin was sent down to the planet alongside the first buildings to protect the workers as they began to get settled, driving off the more dangerous predators as they approached the colony. Given that [the planet] is fairly out of the way, arms and armor wasn't foremost among Paragon's main concerns when sending Paladin. What was, however, was cost. Paladin was already undersupplied, undermanned, and underarmored for their task, but once the Northern Light crashed, this problem was exacerbated. 

Paladin was almost instantly overrun. They simply weren't prepared for the hordes of hostile creatures emerging from the Northern Light, and their lack of gear, manpower, and morale didn't help. Instead of realizing the colony was lost, however, the denizens of the colony grabbed whatever weapon was close to hand and put the preparation of the colony aside for a time to supplement Paladin's lack of, well, everything. And thus, the Militia was born.

# In the Present

Presently, the Militia is dedicated to protecting the colony from incursion by predators, much like Paladin's initial mission was, but they've also been used as exploration guards, pest control, and have even been considered as protection for excursions into the crashed Northern Light. 

Given that the Militia is comprised of individuals who took it among themselves to defend the colony and an underfunded and nearly-defunct PMC, they rely on what gear they can get. Armor is spread thing, and heavier weapons are nearly nonexistent. Most Militiamembers get by with pistols, SMGs, and similar, while whole-body armor is reserved for the rarest of situations. In a pinch, they *can* call on their parent group, Paragon, but due to the distance and time required to send asistance, this is rare, costly, and not usually granted by Paragon. 

# How Do They See Other Factions?

TBD.

The colony's external security.

-	Sort of a HL2 rebel/dutch SWAT/etc. aesthetic. They have a defining armor and color, but they’re definitely not a standing army/PMC/etc. 
o	Give them color accessories for their armor. That way they can be worn on armor and the clothing. 
o	Armor has coloration on it that’s noticeable. Maybe color bands and things. Kneepads? 
-	Sort of a bargain bin PMC that got roped into the equation because nobody wants to shell out the money for a premium CAS-level gunnery. 
-	Group of militia that’s augmenting (and completely enveloping) a smaller corporation that came in to help clear out the creatures around the landing site and colony. 
o	Smaller corporation was a small PMC contractors working for a bigger PMC corporation that was working on making the area safe, not really high end sec, cheap. Once the NL crashed, they’re basically stuck here fighting things off, overstaying their budget and their contract.
o	By default not armed to the teeth. No major armory, but they get their gear from bartering/exploring/etc. Sell their services out to get better equipment. Don’t have good salvage rights, but they get first pick of weapons/etc. 
	Think pistols, bolt actions, etc. 
•	Better equipment through looting, purchasing, etc. Can get supply drops rarely from the corp (event rules, basically) but otherwise are sort of left on their own. 
•	An ERT might be actual corporation professionals that make their way there ASAP, rarely called because it costs the company a lot in ammo and fuel and overtime and hazard pay and…
	Still need to fund their way back home! Sell their guns at the end of the shift to put bread on the table.
	Volunteers do the same, but have to turn it in because they’re volunteers. Explains not keeping guns/equipment between rounds.
-	No actual authority to do anything relating to laws, they’re just here for defense from external forces due to lethal weapons. 
o	Good escorts into the NL, though. 
-	Feel: Militia with a unifying theme and an “us versus the planet” mentality.
