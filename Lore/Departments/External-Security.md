The colony's external security.

-	Sort of a HL2 rebel/dutch SWAT/etc. aesthetic. They have a defining armor and color, but they’re definitely not a standing army/PMC/etc. 
o	Give them color accessories for their armor. That way they can be worn on armor and the clothing. 
o	Armor has coloration on it that’s noticeable. Maybe color bands and things. Kneepads? 
-	Sort of a bargain bin PMC that got roped into the equation because nobody wants to shell out the money for a premium CAS-level gunnery. 
-	Group of militia that’s augmenting (and completely enveloping) a smaller corporation that came in to help clear out the creatures around the landing site and colony. 
o	Smaller corporation was a small PMC contractors working for a bigger PMC corporation that was working on making the area safe, not really high end sec, cheap. Once the NL crashed, they’re basically stuck here fighting things off, overstaying their budget and their contract.
o	By default not armed to the teeth. No major armory, but they get their gear from bartering/exploring/etc. Sell their services out to get better equipment. Don’t have good salvage rights, but they get first pick of weapons/etc. 
	Think pistols, bolt actions, etc. 
•	Better equipment through looting, purchasing, etc. Can get supply drops rarely from the corp (event rules, basically) but otherwise are sort of left on their own. 
•	An ERT might be actual corporation professionals that make their way there ASAP, rarely called because it costs the company a lot in ammo and fuel and overtime and hazard pay and…
	Still need to fund their way back home! Sell their guns at the end of the shift to put bread on the table.
	Volunteers do the same, but have to turn it in because they’re volunteers. Explains not keeping guns/equipment between rounds.
-	No actual authority to do anything relating to laws, they’re just here for defense from external forces due to lethal weapons. 
o	Good escorts into the NL, though. 
-	Feel: Militia with a unifying theme and an “us versus the planet” mentality.
