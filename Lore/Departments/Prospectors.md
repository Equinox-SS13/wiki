-	Mining/Salvage Coop that elects its foremen for the shift. 
o	Whoever gets the role roundstart/joins as it is assumed to have been voted as it prior to the shift.
o	Can’t be voted out mid-shift except if removed with command okay. (to prevent funny business)
o	Don’t have to agree with the choice of prospector, you can be one of the people who didn’t vote for them.
-	Feel: Colony startups and really working underground/salvage.
