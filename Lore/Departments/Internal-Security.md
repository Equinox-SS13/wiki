-	A Port Authority that was required to have the colony set up in the first place. The represent the authority of the government that controls the region of space that the colony is in.
-	Also able to grant colony citizenship and similar, they’re basically bureaucracy. 
-	Think rural cops, marshals from Alien Isolation. They have broad authority to enforce the laws and regulations, but a little more leeway in enforcing things that are harming people. 
-	They’re armed, but they weren’t ready for the incursion of roaches and stuff. 
-	They’re not there to step on the independence of the colony, because it’s legally sanctioned, but they’re there to enforce the law. Defer critical decisions to upper management. 
-	Intended to follow up on the punishment that the other factions/departments are going to dish out. Ban someone from your department? The Port Authority is the one that actually enforces it. 
-	Some sort of minor cop/port authority feel
