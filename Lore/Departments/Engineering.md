-	A craftsmen’s guild in the traditional sense. Funded by a shadow figure that backs the entire thing. Ordered them to put their headquarters here for unspecified reasons. Now sends requests to the department for “masterpieces” to be sent off (think the cargo radio but random orders, like build me 40 dolomite tables.)
o	Work on some adminspawn punishments for failing this?
o	A gold “You Tried” star?
-	Engineering has an agreement with the Prospectors, where the prospectors got the materials for the construction, and engineering produced the materials that built the colony.  
-	Feel ideas:
o	Technofeudal aesthetic? Medieval inspired? It’s structured as a traditional Guild, with the benefactor as a sort of Patron. NOT an engineering cult, just themed as medieval.
	Note: we already have a little bit of this, like artificers and stuff. Would require not a lot of renaming either. 
o	Bootstrapped, trying to do things by the book and by the regulations but you’re working with what they’ve got.
