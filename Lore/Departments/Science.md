-	Main Proposal
o	Generally accelerationist research coop with goals ranging from “research at all costs, ends justify the means” to “technology is going to improve the lives of everyone!”
o	They’re here because they keep getting kicked out of places for their methods and their discourse. 
o	They’re focusing on the NL because it’s the hyperaccelleration of hyperacceleration locations due to a lot of weird lostech and new tech. 
-	Structure: Research collective? Used to be a research cooperative that started getting overrun with the wrong kinds of people. (brilliant but you’ll always roll your eyes around them)
o	Mad scientists, war criminals, normal scientists, humanitarians, etc. All under one roof. 
-	Feel: High tech, clean and organized with a couple of dark backrooms. Sort of organized like a tightly balanced org. They are to the universe what cyberpunk is to us. 
-	Part of their rules/regs are that they don’t care about ethics at all. Just sort of “what happens happens, just don’t be too stupid”
o	“Sci isn’t there to bail out med without getting something out of it.”
	Gain funding, gain ground, gain political favor, gain assistance on trying to get tech from the ship, etc.
o	Map design puts some of their illegal stuff out in the open. Allow people to walk by sci and see what’s going on inside mostly.
	Some hidden rooms for stuff that’s really, really bad.
	Provides a reason for why they keep getting kicked out: they’re bad at hiding their blatantly bad stuff.
