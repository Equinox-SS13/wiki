-	Humanitarian doctors. Humanitarian nonprofit org, structured like a standard hospital?
o	Structure of an NGO - https://www.gdrc.org/ngo/org-chart.html
	Staff is doctors, board is a board of CMOs or something?
o	People who really are looking out for bettering people. 
	Humanists, people who just really want to be doctors, etc. 
o	Aesthetic: 
	Techwear. Equivalent of Retro stuff, pretty much. They’re using slightly secondhand or outdated tech and uniforms, which helps explain why they get their upgraded stuff from sci. 
	Think the Followers of the Apocalypse, humanitarian mission, lacking supplies.
•	Cool labcoats mandatory.
-	Limited equipment and gear. Not perfect, but they have at least one of everything they need. 
o	Example: Sleeper, scanner, cryo tube.
o	They have advanced supplies, but they’re either locked away for emergencies (use the bandages first!) or in short supply so they should be used when absolutely needed.
