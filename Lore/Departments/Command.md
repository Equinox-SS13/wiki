Proposal Information:

-	Feel: standard command. Bureaucracy and plastic and paper and glass. Not a prefab building. Actual admin building, higher class/importance in the structures. 
o	Note: Central building in the colony alongside the Port Authority?
	(put it alongside the landing pad?)
o	Aion suggestion: Special gun for the Captain that has special flair. 
	Cato – Maybe they even had insider knowledge that SOMETHING was going to happen in the region. 
-	Proposal 1
o	Find some way to integrate Orion Capital
o	Somewhat unstructured at the beginning. Very diplomatic with each other but not part of the Port Authority. 
o	They’re the legal binding group that maintains the paperwork and bureaucracy of the area. 
o	Captain is more of a site director that makes sure things are moving forward
	Steward/HoP is Captain’s active hand in censoring things that are not supposed to be public knowledge. 
	Would also add the ability to add protections officers like blueshield and similar protective roles later on. See 
o	Command manages cross-faction negotiation and legal loopholes and things. 
o	Site Director/Premier is a volunteer position. They’re a Directed Role, someone who has an ear open for ideas of other factions.
	Head mediator and coordinator, gives orders to help out struggling departments or solve problems in a traditional captain manner.  
o	A little at odds with the Port Authority because of the necessary secrecy involved in protecting the information here. 
	“Wow, we’ve been given a blessing and a curse here! If information about this gets out, we’ll get swarmed/killed/etc. So let’s only tell them exactly what they need to know…”
	Social balance and social manipulators of the colony. 
-	Proposal 2 (Can have elements merged with Proposal 1 if needed!)
o	Tied into the Port Authority somewhat. A bureaucratic connection to the region’s government as well as a council of heads of staff? 
	The HOS is the enforcement arm of the regional government
	The Steward is the legal and bureaucratic arm of the regional government
•	Handles all the paperwork and everything
•	Think the HoP
	Captain/Site Director is the one put in charge by colony charter
•	Head mediator and coordinator, gives orders to help out struggling departments or solve problems in a traditional captain manner. 
o	The rest of command are the heads of their departments and use command as an arbitration or mediation space, as well as high-level departmental communication and cooperation
